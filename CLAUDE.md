## Next Steps Required

### Phase 5: Competitor Analysis & Content Planning üîÑ (IN PROGRESS)
1. **Website Analysis Tool**: Created `website_crawler.py` for comprehensive competitor research
2. **Target Competitors**: 
   - Origin Steel (https://originsteel.fr/)
   - PMR Slovakia (https://pmr.sk/en)
   - M√©talhom (https://www.metalhom.com/)
3. **Content Strategy**: Analyze competitor content structure to inform Aries website expansion

### Immediate Content Development:
1. ‚úÖ **About page content** - COMPLETED with real company data
2. **Populate product information** - Use competitor analysis insights
3. ‚úÖ **Company images and media** - COMPLETED and properly integrated
4. **Products/Services pages** - Based on competitor content analysis
5. **Set up contact forms**
6. **Configure SEO and metadata**

### Production Deployment:
1. **Ensure TinaCMS works in production**
2. **Test custom domain SSL**
3. **Configure proper redirects**
4. **Set up analytics**

## Key Commands

### Development:
```bash
npm run dev          # Start both TinaCMS and Astro
npm run dev:astro    # Start Astro only
npx tinacms dev      # Start TinaCMS only
npx tinacms build    # Build TinaCMS admin
```

### Deployment:
```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
git add . && git commit && git push  # Deploy via Netlify
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked:
- Astro + Netlify deployment pipeline
- Block-based content architecture
- Git-based workflow
- Component system approach

### What Didn't Work:
- Multiple CMS attempts (Decap, Static, Netlify CMS)
- TinaCMS localhost development mode
- Complex server coordination requirements

### User Feedback:
*"I fled WordPress for easier solutions but I am now in the middle of a config nightmare"*

**Reality Check**: TinaCMS setup is complex despite marketing claims. The user expected WordPress-level simplicity but got developer-tool complexity.

## Alternative Paths Forward

### Option 1: Simplify CMS
- Use the working `/admin-simple` interface
- Build better file-based editing tools
- Focus on content creation over fancy CMS

### Option 2: Different CMS
- Try Forestry.io or Sanity
- Consider Strapi or Contentful
- Evaluate Markdown + Git workflow

### Option 3: Persist with TinaCMS
- Debug admin interface thoroughly
- Get community support from TinaCMS
- Focus on production deployment
