7. We use a machine equipped with an endless rotator generating the plasma flow in the place of the surface we want to cut. The difference is, that the rotator can tilt up to 45⁰ to any side.

8. The robust gantry allows us to reduce the vibrations during operating the machine to a minimum. The compact and powerful design ensures high precision and dynamics that allows us to cut complex bevel contours, thus saving time and handling.

9. Using plasma cutting, the penetrated surface is less disrupted than by using oxygen, but it is necessary to take into consideration a cut surface angle deformation of about 5⁰.

7. The essence of the technology of splitting metal materials with an oxygen flame is the process of burning iron heated to ignition temperature in a stream of oxygen. The cut material is burned (combined) with cutting oxygen to form oxides, which are blown away in the form of liquid slag by the dynamic effect of oxygen from the cutting site. The combustion process, in which various types of iron oxides are formed, is a significantly exothermic reaction, i.e. with a large heat generation at the point of cutting. At the beginning of the process, it is necessary to heat the material at the beginning of the cut to an ignition temperature, in the second phase, oxygen is introduced under high pressure, which burns the iron particles and blows the molten metal out of the cutting joint. oxygen flow.

8. Modern, precise and powerful CNC firing machines from the manufacturers MESSER and MGM are intended for the production of blanks primarily from non-alloy structural steels, steels for refining and boiler steels in thicknesses from 3 to 250 mm at max. table dimensions 3.5 x 16 m.

7. Plazma cutting technology uses a concentrated electric arc that melts the material through the effects of high-temperature plasma rays. All conductive materials can be cut.

8. Accurate and high performance cutting machines with CNC control system from producers VANAD and MESSER are used for precise form cutting of all kinds of mild steel, stainless steel, aluminium and copper. Maximal material thickness varies from 1 to 30 mm with table dimension of 3 x 8 m up to the weight of 8 tones. Symmetric portal shift on the linear track slide in connection with KJELLBERG, HYPERTHERM and FORMIKA plasma systems enable to achieve a high quality cut and high precision of the parts when cutting holes. In the hole cutting it is necessary to count with a minimal hole diameter in multiples of 1,5 of the material thickness.

### Lists
**List 1 (ul):**
- In plasma cutting the surface is less violated than by oxygen cutting, though, it is necessary to count with a 5º undercutting. The undercutting is more significant in the edges of the part.

- It is possible to arrange painting or sandblasting of the parts. If the parts are according to the drawing specifications processed for bending, the parts will always be sandblasted.
- The parts are delivered with a rough surface according to EN 10 163.
- Shape dimension tolerances of parts are delivered according EN 10029.
- Cut surface quality is assured according STN EN ISO 9013 II B grade II. Local surface defects are not taken into consideration.
- The standard delivery time, when the material is available on stock, is from 3 to 10 labour days, after the order confirmation.

7. Our company offers high production capacity with a robotized cell which focuses on laser welding with a high power fibre laser with optical guidance to the point of welding.

8. New and constantly increasing requirements of production practice drive the quantitative and qualitative growth of advanced welding technologies in engineering production. In the field of technologies for joining metallic materials, there is a constant development, which is influenced both by these growing requirements and by the ever-increasing demands on the technological infrastructure necessary for laser technologies.

9. The basis of laser operation is light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation – Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. As such, a laser is essentially a wave of an optical type that belongs to the group of electromagnetic radiation and differs from other types of radiation in terms of wavelength. It is characterized by high coherence, monochromaticity and parallelism of emitted photons. The laser beam is generated in the welding source, from which it is guided through an optical fiber to the laser – welding optics. In this optic, the laser beam beam is directed and focused by means of lenses. The output from the welding optics is therefore a focused laser beam, part of which is reflected when it hits the base material (depending on the material being welded), part passes through the material itself and part is absorbed.

10. The absorbed energy causes melting of the material and its evaporation. Melting and evaporation of the material are accompanied by various effects, e.g. formation of ionization and plasma cloud above the material. The heat affected area – TOO may differ from the theoretically predicted bundle trace diameter (depending on the optics used and the diameter of the optical fiber) due to radiation absorption. Its size and the resulting effect of radiation is primarily determined by the power of the laser source, the areal density of the radiation power, surface conditions and thermal properties. In general, however, the TOO area is very small when using a laser beam, which results in minimizing deformations after welding and thus the necessity of further operations such as machining.

7. The essence of the technology of splitting metal materials with an oxygen flame is the process of burning iron heated to ignition temperature in a stream of oxygen. The cut material is burned (combined) with cutting oxygen to form oxides, which are blown away in the form of liquid slag by the dynamic effect of oxygen from the cutting site. The combustion process, in which various types of iron oxides are formed, is a significantly exothermic reaction, i.e. with a large heat generation at the point of cutting. At the beginning of the process, it is necessary to heat the material at the beginning of the cut to an ignition temperature, in the second phase, oxygen is introduced under high pressure, which burns the iron particles and blows the molten metal out of the cutting joint. oxygen flow.

8. Modern, precise and powerful CNC firing machines from the manufacturers MESSER and MGM are intended for the production of blanks primarily from non-alloy structural steels, steels for refining and boiler steels in thicknesses from 3 to 250 mm at max. table dimensions 3.5 x 16 m.

7. 3D laser cutting, high precision cutting of hollow and open sections and beams.

8. Our technologies are characterized by an option of manual, semi-automatic or automatic loading. The machines enable to cut and process various kinds of beams and shapes. Tubes or rectangular sections are a standard, but with using fixtures you can go to elliptic, H-section, welded, bended sections, even triangular hollow beams. The unloading is also in manual, semi-automatic and automatic option.

9. All these characteristics enable the technologies to be both flexible and highly productive, reducing the processing times, while opening a wide range for a tailor-made production according our customers needs. Using this modern approach towards processing of hollow sections or beams with 3D Laser-cutting, we can subside machining or other operations on these materials.
